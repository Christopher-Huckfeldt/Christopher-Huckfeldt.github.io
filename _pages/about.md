I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Economics at 
[Cornell University](http://economics.cornell.edu). I received a Ph.D. in Economics from NYU under 
the supervision of Gianluca Violante and Mark Gertler in May 2014.

Starting in July 2022, I will be a senior economist at the Division 
of International Finance at the Federal Reserve Board.

My research interests are in macroeconomics and labor economics.
