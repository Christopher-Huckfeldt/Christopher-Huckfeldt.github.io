I am a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Board, in the [Global Modeling Studies](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/ifgms-staff.htm) section of the Division of International Finance. I received a Ph.D. in Economics from NYU under the supervision of Gianluca Violante and Mark Gertler in May 2014.

My research interests are in macroeconomics and labor economics.
