I am a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Board, in the [Global Modeling Studies](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/ifgms-staff.htm) section of the Division of International Finance. I received a Ph.D. in Economics from NYU under the supervision of Gianluca Violante and Mark Gertler in May 2014.

My research interests are in macroeconomics and labor economics.  

The views expressed on this site are my own and should not be interpreted as reflecting the views of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or any other person associated with the Federal Reserve System.
