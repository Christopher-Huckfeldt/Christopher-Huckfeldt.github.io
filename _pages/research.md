> This paper documents that the earnings cost of job loss is concentrated among workers who find reemployment in lower-skill occupations, and that the cost and incidence of such occupation displacement is higher for workers who lose their job during a recession. I propose a model where hiring is endogenously more selective during recessions, leading some unemployed workers to optimally search for reemployment in lower-skill jobs. The model accounts for existing estimates of the size and cyclicality of the present value cost of job loss, and the cost of entering the labor market during a recession.

> We revisit the issue of the high cyclicality of wages of new hires.  We show that after controlling for composition effects likely involving procyclical upgrading of job match quality, the wages of new hires are no more cyclical than those of existing workers. The key implication is that the sluggish behavior of wages for existing workers is a better guide to the cyclicality of the marginal cost of labor than is the high measured cyclicality of new hires wages unadjusted for composition effects. Key to our identification is distinguishing between new hires from unemployment versus those who are job changers. We argue that to a reasonable approximation, the wages of the former provide a composition-free estimate of the wage flexibility, while the same is not true for the latter. We then develop a quantitative general equilibrium model with sticky wages via staggered contracting, on-the-job search, and heterogeneous match quality, and show that it can account for both the panel data evidence and aggregate evidence on labor market volatility.


## Working Papers

<br/>**Temporary and Permanent Layoffs over the Business Cycle: Evidence, Theory, and an Application to the Covid-19 Crisis** (with Mark Gertler and Antonella Trigari) [[pdf]](https://christopher-huckfeldt.github.io/files/GHT2021.pdf)<br/>
> Motivated by the unusual increase in temporary unemployment during the recent recession, this paper develops a quantitative model of unemployment dynamics that distinguishes between temporary and permanent layoffs. We calibrate the model to capture labor market dynamics over the period from 1979 to 2019. We then adapt the full quantitative model to study the effects of the extraordinary increase in temporary layoffs induced by the pandemic.  We also use the model to evaluate how the Paycheck Protection Program may have worked to facilitate the return of workers to employment from temporary layoff. We find that, without PPP, unemployment would have been persistently higher: Firms would have recalled far fewer workers from temporary layoff, and more workers on temporary layoff would have drifted into more persistent unemployment.



## Work in progress

<br/>**The marginal efficiency of active search**<br/>
> The marginal efficiency of active search is the rate at which active search increases overall search efficiency (and thus the probability of finding a job). This paper documents that job-finding probabilities of active searchers fall closer to those of purely-passive searchers during recessions, despite the well-documented countercyclicality of active search effort. The finding rules out the constant marginal efficiency of active search typically assumed in the literature, whereby the elasticity of substitution between active and passive search is infinite; instead, the data support an elasticity of substitution substantially below one. I show that an elasticity below unity introduces a novel search externality into an otherwise standard DMP setting: inefficiently high active search reduces the marginal efficiency of active search during recessions, further increasing unemployment.
